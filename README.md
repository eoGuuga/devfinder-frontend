## üìñ About

This is a Single-Page Application (SPA) serving as the face of DevFinder Pro. It allows users to enter a natural language query (e.g., "python developer with machine learning experience") and displays a dynamic gallery of GitHub developer profiles that semantically match the search.

The application consumes the [DevFinder Pro API](https://eoGuuga-devfinder-api.hf.space) (hosted separately) to retrieve the AI-ranked results.

- **Dynamic Gallery:** Displays results in a responsive grid layout.
- **Relevance Visualization:** The style (opacity, border) of each profile card reflects the AI similarity score, highlighting the most relevant results.
- **Fluid Animations:** Uses `Framer Motion` for smooth cascading entry animations and subtle hover effects, providing a polished user experience.
- **Loading & Error States:** Provides clear visual feedback during searches and in case of failures.
- **Responsive Design:** Interface adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.
