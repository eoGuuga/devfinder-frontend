Modern and interactive user interface for DevFinder Pro, built with React, Vite, and Framer Motion. Consumes the DevFinder Pro API to enable semantic and direct search for GitHub developer profiles.

## üìñ About

This Single-Page Application (SPA) serves as the primary interface for interacting with the DevFinder Pro system. It offers two distinct search modes:

1.  **Semantic Search (AI):** Allows users to input natural language queries (e.g., "python developer interested in IoT projects in Brazil") to discover relevant GitHub profiles based on semantic similarity, powered by the backend API's AI model and Pinecone index.
2.  **Username Search:** Enables users to directly look up a specific GitHub profile by entering the exact username, fetching data in real-time from the backend API (which calls the GitHub API).

The interface is designed to be visually engaging and informative, featuring dynamic layouts, subtle animations, and clear presentation of search results.

## üöÄ Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/eoGuuga/devfinder-frontend.git](https://github.com/eoGuuga/devfinder-frontend.git)
    cd devfinder-frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment Variable:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the project root.
    * Add the URL of your running backend API (local or deployed):
      ```
      VITE_API_URL=[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) 
      # Or use [https://eoGuuga-devfinder-api.hf.space](https://eoGuuga-devfinder-api.hf.space) if testing against the live API
      ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port indicated by Vite).

**Prerequisite:** The DevFinder Pro backend API must be running and accessible at the URL configured in the `.env` file for searches to work.
